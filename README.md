### File Structure
- **App.js:**
    - The code in App.js creates a component.
    - The _export_ JavaScript keyword makes this function accessible outside of this file.
    - The _default_ keyword tells other files using your code that itâ€™s the main function in your file.
- **styles.css:**
    - This file defines the styles for your React app.
- **index.js:**
    - This is the bridge between the component we created in the _App.js_ and the _web browser_.
- **index.html:**
    - This is the main HTML file of the project.
    - In index.js, the code helps populating the components in the html defined in this file.
